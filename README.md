## Nice or Mean Game
Description

## Database SQLite3
From a list of files, select the names that have .txt extension and store them in a SQLite3 database.  Next query them from the database and print them out to the console.  I created functions with arguments to make them more flexible.  They work with any file extension, table name, and db connection passed into them as parameters.
```
createTable(conn, tblName)
storeFileList(conn, tblName, fileList, ext)
printFileList(conn, tblName)
```
